title: Using AI Without Losing Control

I use AI a lot, but not blindly.

## AI Is a Drafting Tool
I treat AI output as a starting point. Not the final answer. I still read, adjust, and sometimes throw things away.

If I don’t understand it, I don’t ship it.

## Be Clear About the Problem First
AI works better when the problem is clear. Vague prompts usually give vague results.

Thinking clearly still matters.

## Judgment Is Still on Me
At the end of the day, I’m responsible for what goes into production. AI helps speed things up, but it does not replace decision-making.

Tools don’t own the outcome. I do.
