Building something that works is very different from building something that ranks. When I started this project, I focused on functionality — live weather data, dynamic routing, and clean UI. But once I shifted toward SEO, I realized the architecture had to change. If you're building for search, you think about crawl paths, internal linking, sitemap control, and content depth from day one. Dynamic data alone isn’t enough; pages need contextual layers to avoid being thin or templated. I also learned that scaling location-based content requires patience and controlled rollout instead of mass generation. Performance and cost considerations, like caching and debounced API calls, matter earlier than you think. This project pushed me to think beyond just code and start thinking like a product owner building for visibility, trust, and long-term growth.
