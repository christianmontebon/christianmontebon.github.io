title: How I Build Things

These are just notes. Not essays. I’m writing them the same way I think about work. Straightforward, practical, and based on what actually happens when you build things.

## Build Around Constraints
Most of the time, the problem is not the solution itself. It’s time, budget, or context. I usually start with what is doable now. Then improve later.

I mean, if something works and solves today’s problem, that already counts.

## Clarity Matters More Than Cleverness
I try to keep things easy to understand. Code, UI, even documentation. If I have to explain something again and again, it probably needs to be simpler.

The point is to reduce thinking, not show how smart the solution is.

## Iteration Beats Overthinking
I rarely get things right on the first try. I build something small, look at it, then adjust. Same with layouts, workflows, and even wording.

What I’m trying to avoid is spending too much time planning something that will change anyway.

## Practical Over Perfect
I usually pick the option that is easier to maintain and explain. Not the most elegant one. If a simpler approach gets the job done and is easier to support, I’m fine with that.

Perfect sounds nice, but it’s expensive.

## Tools Are for Reducing Friction
I use tools, automation, and AI to remove repetitive work. Not to skip thinking. The goal is to spend less time on mechanical stuff and more time on actual decisions.

Less friction means I can focus better.

## Keep Design Out of the Way
I like clean and minimal design. If something looks nice but does not help the user, it probably does not belong.

I’d rather remove things than add more.

## Write the Way I’d Explain It
I write the same way I talk. Direct and clear. I care more about being understood than sounding impressive.

If someone gets the idea without asking follow-up questions, that’s good enough.

These are not strict rules. Just how I usually approach things.
